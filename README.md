# front-end-assignments
a repository to practice front-end development

#### Steps to follow before you commit your code:
- Create a folder with your name in this folder only if it doesn't exist.
- After creating the folder, add a folder respective to your assignment question. For eg. if you are working on HTML-CSS assignment create a folder name similar to the folder which exist under `./Assignment/` folder.
- On creation of the respective assignment folder, create folder name based on assignment number. For eg. For *Assignment-1* create a folder with same name `Assignment-1`.
- Under newly created folder add all the required solution files (html, css, js, etc.)
